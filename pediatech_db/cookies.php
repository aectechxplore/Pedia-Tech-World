            <p>This Cookie Policy explains how <strong>Pedia Tech World</strong> uses cookies and similar technologies to recognize you when you visit our website.</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-slate-800">1. What are Cookies?</h3>
            <p>Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. They are widely used to make websites work more efficiently and to provide information to the website owners.</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-slate-800">2. How We Use Cookies</h3>
            <p>We use cookies for the following purposes:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Essential Cookies:</strong> These are necessary for the website to function correctly. For example, we use a session cookie (`PHPSESSID`) to maintain your login state (e.g., keeping you logged in as an Admin or Employee).</li>
                <li><strong>Functionality Cookies:</strong> These allow us to remember choices you make (such as your username) to provide a more personalized experience.</li>
                <li><strong>Analytics:</strong> We may use tools to track visitor usage patterns to improve our website's performance.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-slate-800">3. Managing Cookies</h3>
            <p>Most web browsers allow you to control cookies through their settings preferences. However, if you limit the ability of websites to set cookies, you may worsen your overall user experience, and features like the Admin/Employee login will not function.</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-slate-800">4. Local Storage</h3>
            <p>In addition to cookies, we may use Local Storage (on your browser) to store simple preferences, such as toggling sidebar states or temporary form data, to enhance interactivity.</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-slate-800">5. Contact</h3>
            <p>If you have any questions about our use of cookies, please contact us at contact@pediatech.com.</p>
